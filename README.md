# Data Structures Exercises in Kotlin

Welcome to the Data Structures Exercises repository! This project contains a series of exercises designed to help you understand and implement various data structures using Kotlin. Each exercise focuses on a different data structure and includes examples and implementations to illustrate their usage.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `src/main/kotlin/`: Contains Kotlin source files.
- `src/test/kotlin/`: Contains test files to validate the implementations.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: This project is set up to work with IntelliJ IDEA. Make sure you have it installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- **Kotlin**: Ensure that Kotlin is installed and configured in your IntelliJ IDEA. Kotlin is supported natively by IntelliJ IDEA.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-exercises-kotlin.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:**

   - Launch IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Select `File` > `Open...`.
   - Navigate to the cloned repository directory and select it.

3. **Build the project:**

   IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect the Kotlin files and set up the project. To build the project, you can use the `Build` menu or click on the `Build` icon in the toolbar.

4. **Run Exercises:**

   Each exercise has its own main function or test cases. You can run these directly from IntelliJ IDEA by navigating to the file and selecting `Run` from the context menu or the toolbar.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to an Exercise:**

   Open any of the exercise files in the `src/main/kotlin/` directory. Each file is named according to the data structure it deals with.

2. **Review the Code:**

   Each exercise contains comments and documentation explaining the implementation of the data structure.

3. **Run the Code:**

   You can run the code by right-clicking on the Kotlin file and selecting `Run`. You can also create and run tests to verify the correctness of the implementations.
